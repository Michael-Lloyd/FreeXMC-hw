# FreeXMC-hw

An open source, open hardware Brushless DC Motor (BLDC) drive and control stack using the XMC4400 series microcontrollers. 

This repository contains all of the hardware files. 

You can find my current progress on the ![Hackaday](https://hackaday.io/project/187204-freexmc) log. 
Every time a board gets tested, the files used for that will appear in this repository as well (under the development branches).
